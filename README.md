# Conv-Net-Pred-SignLang

### Objective: Build several Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that given an image of a hand showing one of the letters A-I (Sign Language), predicts which letter is being represented.

We will explore several convolutional architectures decribed in the Jupyter Notebook file.
